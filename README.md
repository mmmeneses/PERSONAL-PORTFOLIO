# PERSONAL WEBSITE PORTFOLIO 

This web portfolio showcases a range of front-end development skills, focusing on creating a dynamic and responsive user experience. Key techniques implemented include:

* Dynamic Background Color Change: A notable feature is the background color that transitions based on the time of day. This is achieved using JavaScript to fetch the current time and then conditionally apply different CSS styles or manipulate the background color property directly. This technique demonstrates an understanding of JavaScript's Date object and DOM manipulation.

* Responsive Navigation Bar: The portfolio features a navigation bar designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes. This responsiveness is likely implemented using CSS media queries. These queries allow for different styling rules to be applied based on the viewport width, ensuring the menu remains usable and aesthetically pleasing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Techniques such as flexible box (Flexbox) or grid layout might also be employed for structuring the menu items and ensuring their proper alignment across different screen dimensions.

* Intentional Code Implementation: The codebase reflects a deliberate approach to problem-solving. For example, the implementation of the time-based background likely involved considering how to efficiently check the time and update the UI without performance degradation. Similarly, the responsive menu's code would demonstrate a focus on creating a maintainable and scalable solution for handling different layouts. The choice of specific HTML structures, CSS properties, and JavaScript functions would have been driven by the requirements of these features, aiming for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to web standards.
